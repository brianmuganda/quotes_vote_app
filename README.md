# quotes_vote_app
We are creating an app using angular that will enable users to upvote or down vote on quotes posted by themselves or other users
##how it works
A user is able to  input content such as quotes on the form provided and add their quote on site. They are also able to delete the quote, 
upvote or down vote on other quotes.
##installation
So far this is only a web app and as such there is no requirements for installation. We seek to make future improvements for it to be downloadable on mobile devices.
# generation

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 12.1.1.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
